Hello! Or should I say ".... . .-.. .-.. ---"

This is my Morse code translator and you can either convert English into Morse Code or Morse Code to English.

Simply press the Selector at the top to choose which way you want to convert and start typing in the text box at the top. Underneath you should have some Morse code returned to you.

Ensure that when you are converting from morse code to English, you separate each letter with a spacebar

If you click on the link in the top-right you'll be taken to a webpage that goes through the history and invention of Morse Code.
